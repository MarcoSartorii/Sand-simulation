This is a sand falling simulator made with tkinter (for now is basically just paint)

Used python3.11
```
pyenv install 3.11
```

I need to implement the falling logic (hope it is not to heavy and fast enough when lots of pixels are processed)
If you want to try it open CONSTS.py and modify values there as you prefer.

(I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I CANNOT GENERATE requirements.txt)

Do it yourself!
